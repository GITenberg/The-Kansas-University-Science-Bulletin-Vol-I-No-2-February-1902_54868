<p>It is the object of these studies to follow carefully the spermatid
transformations, and, if possible, to get a complete series
of changes occurring therein. I do not pretend that I have as
yet found all the stages, but in the present paper will publish
observations made on <i>Gryllus assimilis</i> pertaining chiefly to the
nebenkern, of which I have found some stages not previously
described, as far as I know. I shall first describe my own findings,
and then compare them with the results of others.</p>

<div><a name="methods" id="methods"></a>
<h3>I. Methods.</h3>
</div>

<p>While other fixing agents were used, Flemming’s chromo-acetic-osmic
mixture (strong) proved the best. Its fixation was satisfactory in
all but a few stages, where the chemical changes going on in the cell
are such that it seems difficult, probably impossible, to secure
good, clear results; at least, neither Gilson’s nor Zenker’s mixture
did any better on cells in these stages.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[48]</a></span></p>

<p>Heidenhain’s iron-hæmatoxylin stain gave the best results, although
Flemming’s three-color method was very satisfactory.</p>

<p>Most of the observations are made from sectioned material, but smear
preparations were used for advanced spermatozoa.</p>

<div><a name="material" id="material"></a>
<h3>II. Material.</h3>
</div>

<p>The first observations were made in January of the present year on
some material prepared by Professor McClung, to whom I wish here
to make most grateful acknowledgment for proposing the line of
investigation, and for many helpful suggestions during the progress
of the same. The testes were those of adult insects, and showed
mostly only mature or almost mature spermatozoa. Enough spermatids
were seen to indicate that their transformation into spermatozoa was
somewhat peculiar.</p>

<p>The material for the drawings was taken from specimens collected
under stones and boards on and near the University campus, at
Lawrence, Kan. Young nymphs of <i>Gryllus</i> were caught as early as
March 1, but the cells of the testes were all in the spermatogonia
and spermatocyte stages. During the early part of May, after the
nymphs had passed their third molt, crickets were secured whose
testes showed all stages of development and transformation.</p>

<p><i>Gryllus assimilis</i>, the common black field cricket, has paired
testes lying in the anterior dorsal part of the abdomen. These have
a whitish transparent appearance, which becomes duller in the adult,
showing sometimes a slight yellowish tinge. The shape of each is
that of a somewhat conically rounded body, not unlike a flattened
strawberry. Each testis consists of a central rachis about 3 mm.
long, from which extend a large number of curved follicles varying in
length from 1 to 3 mm.</p>

<p>The follicles are larger toward the blind end and taper toward
the rachis. Each follicle is divided into cysts, but more often
transversely than longitudinally, for frequently one cyst occupies
the whole follicle in cross-section. The cysts toward the rachis end
of the follicle are much longer and narrower than those of the blind
end. The cells are not very large and contain twenty-four chromosomes
in the spermatogonial generations; eleven and twelve were most
frequently found after the reduction.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[49]</a></span></p>

<p>The follicles of the cricket testis show the different cell
generations and the same relative arrangement of them as McClung
(’00) found in <i>Hippiscus</i>, and Sutton (’00) in <i>Brachystola</i>.
The spermatogonia are nearest the blind end of the follicles,
spermatocytes next, and the spermatids following the latter. The
cells of a cyst are not, as in <i>Anasa</i> (Paulmier, ’99), “in the
same stage of development,” but only approximately so, for some
cysts show cells in the metaphase, while others have reached the
telophase. Successive cysts, as in <i>Brachystola</i>, do not show
successive stages; for, frequently, growing spermatocytes and late
spermatids, or even young spermatozoa, were observed side by side.
The individual cells in division pass through prophases, metaphases,
anaphases, and telophases—these terms being used according to their
usually accepted meanings. (See McClung, ’00.) In this paper I shall
begin with the cell when it has reached the telophase of the second
spermatocyte division; that is, just after the chromosomes have
reached the poles of the spindle.</p>

<div><a name="observations" id="observations"></a>
<h3>III. Observations.</h3>
</div>

<h4>(<i>a</i>) <span class="smcap">the nucleus.</span></h4>

<p>The chromatin in <i>Gryllus</i> behaves very much as Henking (’91) has
described for <i>Pyrrhocoris</i>, and Paulmier (’99) for <i>Anasa</i>. At the
end of the anaphase the chromosomes are crowded together at the
poles of the spindle. (<a href="#plate_ii">Fig. 1.</a>) A clear space begins to
be formed around them, especially on the equatorial side. (<a href="#plate_ii">Fig. 2.</a>)
They then separate and are scattered somewhat evenly over the nuclear membrane
when it is formed, as seen in <a href="#plate_ii">figs. 4, 5, and 6</a>. Soon
protuberances appear on the surface of the individual chromosomes, making their
outlines irregular. At about this time they begin to show a granular
structure. The chromosomes break up more and more, and soon the
chromatin appears in irregularly arranged patches or blotches of
granules of various sizes. (<a href="#plate_ii">Fig. 8.</a>)</p>

<p>Meanwhile the nucleus has slowly increased in size. It reaches its
maximum, which is probably about treble its original diameter, before
the cell begins to elongate. The granules have been breaking up into
finer and finer pieces, until, a little after the cell has reached
its maximum, the chromatin has largely disappeared, or, to be more
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[50]</a></span>
exact, has lost its affinity for stains. (<a href="#plate_ii">Fig. 16.</a>) As
the cell begins to elongate, the nucleus goes to one end, namely, that toward
the periphery of the cyst. (<a href="#plate_ii">Figs. 14 and 15.</a>) The
chromatin again frequently appears in patches as the cell decreases in size.
(<a href="#plate_iii">Figs. 33 and 36.</a>) In many cells the patches never disappear.
When it has diminished to less than half its maximum diameter, the nucleus
begins to elongate, becoming elliptical, and finally forms the long,
tube-like head of the spermatozoon. (<a href="#plate_iii">Figs. 43 and 45.</a>)</p>

<p>I found here that the nucleus was hollow, or, better, that it
showed a clear space within. For a long time it contains the many
chromatin granules, as seen in <a href="#plate_iii">figs. 39, 40, and 41</a>; but
at last the walls seem to attract all these granular masses, and the center is
entirely clear, as in <a href="#plate_iii">fig. 45</a>. In <a href="#plate_iii">fig. 44</a>
are shown cross-sections of spermatozoa heads, of the stage of <a href="#plate_iii">fig. 43</a>.
In <a href="#plate_iii">fig. 45</a> we have a mature spermatozoon head.</p>

<p>The <i>accessory chromosome</i> in <i>Gryllus</i> lags behind during the
spermatogonial divisions, just as in <i>Xiphidium</i> (McClung, ’99),
and retains its identity all through the growth period, in many
cases becoming quite large. At first it cannot be distinguished
in the spermatid, but soon its stronger stain and exemption from
disintegration make it apparent. (<a href="#plate_ii">Fig. 4.</a>) It is
flattened against the nuclear wall and, unlike Paulmier’s “small chromosome,”
it does not break up but remains intact, as Henking and McClung have
described. (<a href="#plate_ii">Figs. 14, 18</a>, <a href="#plate_iii">32, 37</a>,
and others.) It gets larger and then smaller, and is finally lost
in the rest of the chromatin, as the latter condenses to form the
spermatozoon head. I was not able to see that it occupied one side of
the elongating head, as McClung describes it in <i>Xiphidium</i>. The darker
stain and regular contour, and sometimes its greater size, made it in
most stages quite evident.</p>

<h4>(<i>b</i>) <span class="smcap">cytoplasmic structures.</span></h4>

<p>It is in the cytoplasmic structures that <i>Gryllus</i> shows some things
that have not been described, so far as I know; yet I almost hesitate
to enter the discussion concerning the nebenkern, the mitosome, the
idiozome, the archoplasm, the attraction sphere, the acrosome, the
“mitochondrion körper” and other bodies which have been described in
the extra-nuclear parts of the germ-cell. But because I have been
unable to find in any of the papers a description of a structure
like the one in <i>Gryllus</i>, I shall proceed to describe the nebenkern
as I find it. I shall interpret the appearances as far as possible,
leaving to others, or to later efforts, the complete harmonizing of
this element with the structures of other species.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[51]</a></span></p>

<p>Before I proceed, I would add my protest against the name
“nebenkern,” as voiced by Calkins (’95), Erlanger (’96), Meves (’00),
and others. It is inapt and not at all descriptive or distinctive.
But since we have the word, and investigators will use it to mean
something, I think it would be best to restrict the word, as Calkins
and Erlanger suggest, to the remaining spindle fibers and connective
fibers which go to each spermatid and which have an important part
in forming the tail membrane. I shall retain the name for a further
reason, which St. George (’97) gives for first using it, “weil
sie die Frage nach der Herkunft dieses Gebildes offen lässt.” A
comparison of the literature will convince any one that the origin of
this element is still a much-disputed question.</p>

<h5>1.—<i>Nebenkern.</i></h5>

<p>There are, in <i>Gryllus</i> spermatids, two quite permanent and prominent
extra-nuclear bodies. The larger of these I shall call <i>nebenkern</i>,
because I believe it originates from the spindle remains, and goes to
form the tail covering. Its behavior is as follows: At the beginning
of the telophase the fibers which had connected the centrosomes with
the chromosomes bulge out like barrel staves, as Henking (’91) has
described. These break loose from the chromosomes and centrosomes
as the clear space begins to form around the chromatin mass (<a href="#plate_ii">fig. 2</a>);
but they are not separated into two rings, as in <i>Anasa</i>
and <i>Pyrrhocoris</i>. As the dividing cell membrane is formed, the
middle portions of the fibers are drawn together and the so-called
“mid-body” is formed. Some of the fibers unite, producing thicker
ones, as seen in <a href="#plate_ii">figs. 1, 2, and 3</a>.
In the last-named figure some of the central fibers seem to be still
united with those of the companion spermatids.</p>

<p>As the daughter-cell shortens and the nucleus takes a more central
position these fibers unite still more, shorten, bend together
(<a href="#plate_ii">figs. 4, 5, and 6</a>), and finally assume the
shape shown in <a href="#plate_ii">fig. 7</a>. I shall
call it for the present the “striated condition,” or simply “striated
nebenkern.” The shape resembles that of an egg with rather sharply
drawn-out ends. The surface is occupied at intervals with deeply
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[52]</a></span>
staining lines which look much like hoops. In most cases the long
axis of the nebenkern is at right angles to the axis of the spindle
from which it was formed, while the striæ, or dark lines, are in
planes parallel to it, as is seen in <a href="#plate_ii">figs. 7 and 8<i>a</i></a>.
In a few cases the lines are parallel to the long axis of the nebenkern, as shown in
<a href="#plate_ii">fig. 8<i>b</i></a>. <a href="#plate_ii">Fig. 9</a> exhibits
a partial end view of the nebenkern, while <a href="#plate_ii">fig. 26</a>
represents a polar view in all planes.</p>

<p>The fibers in <a href="#plate_ii">figs. 4 and 5</a> are not all in the same
plane, giving frequently, with changing focus, the impression that the lines are
the edges of plates. Even in <a href="#plate_ii">figs. 7 and 8</a>, the appearances
shown made me hesitate for some time before I dared say that the lines
represent striæ on the surface and not plates extending through the
body. But the end views (<a href="#plate_ii">figs. 9 and 26</a>) and the two
drawings in <a href="#plate_ii">fig. 19</a> show clearly that we are dealing with
encircling hoops and not dividing plates. Just how or why the fibers bend and assume
the shape of <a href="#plate_ii">figs. 7 and 8</a> I am not able to say, but I am
sure it is not an artefact, as might be supposed, because I have found them
occupying whole cysts of several testes, and nearly all of them were as regular
and definite as <a href="#plate_ii">fig. 7</a>.<a name="FNanchor_A_1" id="FNanchor_A_1"></a><a href="#Footnote_A_1" class="fnanchor">[A]</a></p>

<p>I have found the nebenkern in its perfect condition (<a href="#plate_ii">fig. 7</a>)
only in material fixed in Flemming; although Zenker’s fixation showed some of
the breaking-up stages. This may be due partly to poorer fixation in
other mixtures and partly to chance, as not so many testes fixed in
other agents were examined, and the appearance evidently represents
a very brief stage. These fibers now begin to break up, and we get
figures that remind one of Meves’s “mitochondrion körper”; that is, a
darker staining center and radiating lines to the outer ring. (<a href="#plate_ii">Fig.11.</a>)
Sometimes stages a little later recall Paulmier’s “blackberry
stage.” (<a href="#plate_ii">Figs. 12 and 25.</a>) <a href="#plate_ii">Fig. 19<i>a</i></a>
is a surface view and <a href="#plate_ii">fig. 19<i>b</i></a> an optical section of a
nebenkern that is in the process of breaking up. <a href="#plate_ii">Figs. 20 and 21</a>
have a part of one end cut off, while <a href="#plate_ii">fig. 23</a> is a polar view.
<a href="#plate_ii">Fig. 22</a> is probably a forming blackberry stage.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[53]</a></span></p>

<p>All the above are brief stages, and we soon get the appearance of
<a href="#plate_ii">figs. 13-16</a>. Here we have the darkly staining central ball
surrounded by a clear space, enclosed by a ring, as Meves (’00) found it in
<i>Pygæra</i>. The central ball sometimes shows vacuoles (<a href="#plate_ii">fig. 16</a>),
but most frequently stains as one mass. In some cysts with cells
resembling <a href="#plate_ii">fig. 16</a>, it is difficult to distinguish between
nucleus and nebenkern, yet the latter’s stain is never as intense as that of
chromatin. The stages shown in <a href="#plate_ii">figs. 13 and 14</a> persist
for a long time, and it is probable that this is the end of the telophase and
the beginning of the spermatid transformations. I have treated the
above more in detail and shown more drawings than its importance may
deserve, but it is in these stages that <i>Gryllus</i> seems to differ
from other species, and I have tried to describe and illustrate the
appearances and changes fully.</p>

<p class="space-below2">As the cell elongates, the axial filament
grows out, the nebenkern approaches it, and a junction is effected
in such a way that the axial filament runs over the surface of the
nebenkern. (<a href="#plate_ii">Figs. 18</a>, <a href="#plate_iii">27, 28, and 30</a>.)
At first the nebenkern is still almost round, but it begins to elongate and the
dark inner ball sends out a protrusion to the nucleus, and sometimes back
to the point of separation between the external envelope and the
axial filament. The outside ring disappears and the dark mass moves
down the axial filament. (<a href="#plate_iii">Fig. 31.</a>) In many cases it
breaks up into several small drops, which appear at intervals on the axial
filaments. (<a href="#plate_iii">Figs. 34 and 36.</a>) In fig. 38 is seen such
a hanging drop. In this way the nebenkern material is distributed over the axial
filament and forms a sheath around it.</p>

<div class="footnote"><p>
<a name="Footnote_A_1" id="Footnote_A_1"></a><a href="#FNanchor_A_1"><span class="label">[A]</span></a>
Professor McClung, Mr. Sutton, and Mr. Blackman, of
Kansas University, and Doctor Child and Mr. Harper, of Chicago
University, have seen my preparations, and all confirm my statement
that the appearance is <i>not</i> an artefact.</p></div>

<h5>2.—<i>The Acrosome.</i></h5>

<p>The second extra-nuclear body I shall call the acrosome, as it
forms the point of the spermatozoon head. I could not trace its
origin, because the fixation was not definite in some of the early
stages. <a href="#plate_ii">Fig. 4</a> shows a small, darkly staining body,
which may be a centrosome, but more likely is the beginning of the acrosome,
of which <a href="#plate_ii">figs. 7, 9 and 10</a> show developing stages,
and <a href="#plate_ii">figs. 11, 13 and 15</a> more advanced ones. Sometimes
the central portion stains darkest (<a href="#plate_ii">figs. 11</a>,
<a href="#plate_iii">32, and 36</a>), but more frequently there is a small
clearer space in the center surrounded by a ring or band of darker material.
(<a href="#plate_ii">Figs. 10, 13</a>, <a href="#plate_iii">27, and 30</a>.)
This ring usually stains darker on one side, very often on the side toward the nucleus.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[54]</a></span></p>

<p>The position, which is, with few exceptions, in the angle between the
nucleus and the nebenkern, induces me to consider the differently
staining bodies as the same organ of the cell. For some time after
the nebenkern has disappeared the acrosome keeps its position;
then it approaches the nuclear wall, flattens against it, and
later wanders to the apical end, where it forms the tip of the
spermatozoon. (<a href="#plate_iii">See figs. 32-36 and 39-42</a>.)
<a href="#plate_ii">Fig. 16</a> shows the acrosome back of the
nebenkern. It is not an isolated example, still, I think, it is an
abnormality. <a href="#plate_iii">Fig. 37</a> shows an apparent division of
the acrosome. I did not see enough instances to consider it a regular occurrence.</p>

<h5>3.—<i>The Axial Filament.</i></h5>

<p>As the cell is elongating, the axial filament is seen apparently
growing out of the nucleus. I do not mean to say that it grows out
of the nuclear substance, but in almost every cell observed, where
the axial filament was incomplete, there was rather a large mass of
chromatin gathered at the place where the axial filament was attached
to the nucleus. It may be that the smaller one of the extra-nuclear
bodies in <a href="#plate_ii">figs. 4, 7 and 9</a> is a centrosome which is
passing to the equatorial region of the nucleus, where it later develops the
axial filament. As already noted, the axial filament does not pass through
the nebenkern, but only over its surface. <a href="#plate_iii">Fig. 29, <i>a</i>, <i>b</i>, and <i>c</i></a>,
shows different cross-sections through the elongating cell. In <i>b</i>
the axial filament was cut at an angle.</p>

<h5>4.—<i>The Centrosome.</i></h5>

<p>I have not followed the centrosome through its migrations. In <a href="#plate_ii">fig. 2</a>
one of the two bodies is the centrosome, but I did not trace its changes farther.</p>

<h5>5.—<i>Cell Body.</i></h5>

<p>The cells, up to the stage of <a href="#plate_ii">figs. 13 or 14</a>, have been
scattered promiscuously through the cyst; but as the cell begins to elongate,
the one end becomes the anterior-nuclear end, and it shifts to the
periphery of the cyst. The central part of the cyst now shows the
so-called central lumen. As the lengthening goes on the heads of
the forming spermatozoa are all turned toward the distal end of the
cyst. The cyst becomes very narrow and long, apparently preparing
to contain the long, slender spermatozoa. Near the rachis the
spermatozoa seem much twisted, and I surmise that they turn so as to
have the head foremost when set free into the <i>vas deferens</i>.
<a href="#plate_iii">Fig. 42</a> may indicate some such behavior.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[55]</a></span></p>

<h4>(<i>c</i>) <span class="smcap">the spermatozoon.</span></h4>

<p>The mature spermatozoon consists: (1) of a sharp, spear-like
point; (2) a tube-like head about .02 mm. long, composed of a
densely staining outer wall and a clearer central cavity; and (3)
a filamentous tail about .5 mm. long. The point comes from the
acrosome, the head from the nucleus, and the tail from the axial
filament and nebenkern. While I do not deny the presence of a middle
piece, my observations do not warrant me in describing one, although
<a href="#plate_iii">fig. 40</a> would suggest it.</p>

<h3>IV. Comparison of Results.</h3>
</div>

<p>Dr. R. von Erlanger (’97, 1, and ’97, 2) and Dr. F. Meves (’00) have
given excellent discussions of the literature on the nebenkern. I
cannot do better than direct the attention of other investigators
to them. Hence, I shall discuss only such authors and such points
as have special bearing on my own results. The spermatid changes in
the Gryllidæ have been studied, so far as I know, only by St. George
(’67) and by vom Rath (’92).</p>

<p class="blockquot"> St. George, in his early paper, described the
transformation process in the “Hausgrille” along with other insects.
He found the “Nebenkörper,” and saw that it took a part in forming
the envelope of the axial filament, a small particle remaining near
the nucleus and other drops of it appearing at intervals on the
tail. In his paper on <i>Blatta</i> (’86, 1) he accepted Bütchli’s name,
“nebenkern,” and traced its origin to the spindle remains. In his
paper on <i>Phratora</i> (’86, 2) he takes up the description of the
nebenkern in the spermatocytes and spermatogonia. In the spermatid,
he describes the blackberry stage in these words: “Während das andere
(not nucleus) Körperchen weniger lebhaft gefärbt als ein kleiner
Fadenknäuel mit unregelmässigem Contour erscheint.” </p>

<p>There can be no true nebenkern in the spermatogonia and
spermatocytes, as St. George first used the word, and as I have
limited its application. But St. George found the object, traced its
origin and fate, and described several of the stages as they appear
in <i>Gryllus</i>.</p>

<p class="blockquot"> Vom Rath (’92) found <i>Gryllotalpa</i> very poor
material for following the spermatid changes. However, he described
an oval body which he found varied in appearance, depending on the
method of fixation. He calls it the “nebenkern” and thinks it goes to
help form the tail. </p>

<p>The description is too incomplete for comparison. Judging from
<i>Gryllus</i>, I question its being very poor material.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[56]</a></span></p>

<p class="blockquot"> Bütschli (’71) studied the spermatid
transformations in Acrididæ and Locustidæ along with that of other
animals. He saw the object formerly described by St. George and named
it “nebenkern.” He saw it divide into halves, elongate, and form the
spermatozoon tail. </p>

<p>The dividing of the nebenkern into halves seems to be an appearance
quite common in insect spermatogenesis. I have myself
seen it in several genera of Acrididæ—<i>Hippiscus</i>, <i>Arphia</i>,
<i>Melanoplus</i>, and <i>Brachystola</i>; besides Bütschli, St. George,
Henneguy, Platner, Paulmier and others have described it.</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p> Platner in his studies has given special attention to the
nebenkern. In his first paper on “Pulmonates” (’85) he did not trace
the origin of the nebenkern, but described it as consisting of four
to six rods of different lengths and irregularly bent. These were
connected, forming an irregular polygon. In its later stages he saw
it with a mass of protoplasm pass down along the primary tail—an
early protrusion of protoplasm. Finally it is lost.</p>

<p>In his succeeding paper (’86, 1) he studied the “nebenkern”
spindle remains—in the spermatogonia and spermatocytes of pulmonates.
In the spermatids, as in the former generations of cells, the
nebenkern grows out of the nucleus, where it, with the chromatin,
had formed the spireme. It appears as a loop, which becomes larger,
twisted, and entangled, and finally breaks loose from the nucleus.
Later it goes to form the spiral covering of the primary tail,
changing it to the axial filament and true tail.</p>

<p>In his next paper (’86, 2) he describes the changes when the
dividing of the protoplasm lags behind in the spermatocyte divisions.
His description agrees in so many points with my own, that I shall
quote his exact words:</p>

<p>“Die Spindelfasern hingegen contrahiren sich mehr und mehr
nach dem Equator hin, wobei sie mit ein ander verschmelzen und
merkwürdiger Weise je weiter dieser Verdichtungsprocess fort
schreitet um so mehr an Tinctions fähigkeit speciell gegenüber
dem Hämatoxylin gewinnen. Sie stellen jetzt zwei dreieckige oder
hakenförmige Gebilde dar, die mit der Spitze noch im Equator
zusammenhängen mit der breiten Seite sind sie den zugehörigen
Zellen zugewendet. Hier sind ihre Grenzen undeutlicher, verwaschen
und zeigen hier auch noch häufig eine streifige Beschaffenheit,
welche auf ihren Ursprung hin weist. Zuweilen lassen sich einzelne
Fäden noch eine beträchtliche Strecke weit in das Protoplasma
hinein verfolgen, welches zwischen ihnen und den sich ausbildenden
Zellkernen liegt.”</p>

<p>The “häkenformige Gebilde” moves away from the periphery, its
sides elongate, break, and unite at the nuclear end, thus form the
polygonal nebenkern. “Derselbe geht also in diesem Falle direckt aus
den Spindelfasern hervor.” When the protoplasm does divide a similar
process takes place. The spindle remains divide at an equatorial line
and each half forms a nebenkern, and, as he says: “Also auch hier
geht der Nebenkern direckt aus den Spindelfasern hervor. Vielleicht
geht in den Spermatiden der Nebenkern überhaupt immer aus den
Spindelfasern hervor, in dem die langfädige Verbindüngsbrücke, die
ihn oft mit dem Kern verbindet, sich wohl als ein noch einige zeit
persisttirender Rest der esteren deuten lässt.”</p>

<p>In his paper on <i>Limax</i> (’89, 1) he followed the nebenkern through
all the divisions and thinks it a constant organ of the cell. In the
second part of the paper on <i>Helix</i> and <i>Paludina</i> the nebenkern
was considered as formed from the remains of the spindlepole and the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[57]</a></span>
centrosome. Later Platner (’89, 2) found the nebenkern in the
pancreas cells. In reports upon <i>Pygæra</i> and <i>Sphinx</i> he changed
the name nebenkern to mitosome. The centrosome lies in front of the
nucleus and forms the point of the head. This he calls the nebenkern.
From the spindle remains arise two bodies. A large, fibrous one from
the equatorial end has a clear space around it and the axial filament
passes through it. It soon elongates and forms the tail. This is the
large mitosome. The other is much smaller and arises from the polar
end of the spindle fibers. It takes its place in the angle between
the large mitosome and the nucleus. Here it persists till the nucleus
begins to elongate, when it lengthens and surrounds the basal end of
the spermatozoon tail. This is the small mitosome.</p></div>

<p>Platner (’85) saw a true nebenkern. I have already criticized the
use of the word “nebenkern,” as the name for the spindle remains in
the spermatocytes. Platner himself later denied the nuclear origin
of the nebenkern. His results (’86, 2) agree with mine concerning
the uniting, converging, staining and bending of the spindle-fiber
remains and their passing to the tail. Again, Platner (’89, 1)
probably followed the centrosome and attraction sphere, as well
as the nebenkern, in the second part of the paper on <i>Helix</i> and
<i>Paludina</i>. In the pancreas the body is a result of secretion, and
is not a nebenkern. In <i>Pygæra</i> Platner’s large mitosome is the real
nebenkern, as shown by its fibrous structure, its surrounding clear
space and destiny. His small mitosome is what I have described as the
acrosome, and he is mistaken as to its final use. The body he called
centrosome in the nucleus is the persisting accessory chromosome.
Such would be my interpretation of his figures.</p>

<p class="blockquot"> Henking (’91) has followed the spermatid
changes in <i>Pyrrhocoris</i> quite carefully. He finds that the fibers
between the chromatin masses are separated into peripheral fibers and
central spindle fibers. The first, a part of the second and the yolk
mass, forms the nebenkern, which passes down over the axial filament.
The rest of the central fibers form the mitosome. This takes its
position at the angle between the nebenkern and the nucleus. On the
surface of the nucleus it passes to the anterior end, then back to
its original position. A piece now is constricted off and disappears,
while the rest, increasing its affinity for stains, again wanders to
the anterior pole of the nucleus, and becomes the acrosome. </p>

<p>The large amount of yolk substance is a disturbing element in
<i>Pyrrhocoris</i>, but the nebenkern agrees with that of <i>Gryllus</i>
in having the same origin and destiny, as does also the acrosome in fate
and position. Besides, there is much similarity in the stages, as
seen by comparing Henking’s fig. 63 with my <a href="#plate_ii">fig. 25</a>,
and his fig. 85 with my <a href="#plate_iii">fig. 32</a>.</p>

<p class="blockquot"> Wilcox (’95 and ’96) described the spermatid
metamorphosis in <i>Caloptenus</i>. The interzonal fibers, a long,
striated body composed very plainly of distinct fibers, contracts
longitudinally, and the corners round themselves off, and this forms
the nebenkern. It loses its fibrous structure, comes close to the
nucleus, and then grows out into the axial filament. The centrosome
moves half way around the nucleus and lies between the latter and the
nebenkern. Later the centrosome becomes the middle piece. </p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[58]</a></span>
This description does not give much detail nor do the drawings
show the stages clearly. As far as given, the formation
of the nebenkern is the same as in <i>Gryllus</i>; but in <i>Gryllus</i> the
axial filament is not formed from the nebenkern, as can be
plainly seen from <a href="#plate_ii">fig. 17</a>.</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p> Erlanger (’96), in a short paper, discusses the use of the term
“nebenkern,” and suggests limiting it as is done in this paper. He
opposes St. George’s opinion, that the nebenkern comes from the
cytomicrosomes. In <i>Blatta</i> the cytomicrosomes are preserved during
the whole process of mitosis, and have no connection with the spindle
fibers, but during the telophase they collect in reduced numbers
around the daughter nuclei.</p>

<p>In 1897 he called the collection of granules around the
centrosome, the centrodeutoplasm. He considers them to be identical
with St. George’s cytomicrosomes and the archoplasm (or attraction
sphere) of other writers. In order to harmonize results, he suggests
that, since the centrosome sometimes wanders around the nucleus,
the centrodeutoplasm (or sphere) may unite with the spindle remains
in some cases to form one body, as shown by the descriptions of
Henking, Henneguy, Meves, and others. He later (’97, 2) describes
the so-called “sphere,” and distinguishes between it and the true
nebenkern. </p></div>

<p>I would strongly commend his excellent discussion of literature and
his careful comparison of the results of investigators. He has shown
clearly that the nebenkern comes from the spindle remains.</p>

<p>Calkins (’96) finds that the nebenkern comes from the spindle fibers
and is useless in the cell. But <i>Lumbricus</i> is peculiar in having
the nebenkern simply disintegrate, for, in many cases, he admits
that the nebenkern has an important function. I do not have access
to Henneguy’s or Bolles-Lee’s or Toyama’s works, yet I should judge
from Erlanger’s and Meves’s criticism that all of these have the
nebenkern originate from the spindle remains, and Henneguy describes
it as having a “fibrillar appearance,” and Bolles-Lee as “fibrillar
structure.” Accordingly, I think that each of these has discovered
the correct origin of the structure, and I do not doubt that there
is, at least in the first two, a more or less direct change from the
spindle remains to the nebenkern.</p>

<p class="blockquot"> Paulmier (’99) finds that in <i>Anasa</i> the
nebenkern comes from the yolk mass and remains of the spindle fibers.
A part of this mass separates off, while the whole is still in a
confused condition, and forms the acrosome. The nebenkern forms the
tail sheath, while the acrosome forms the point to the head. </p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[59]</a></span>
A comparison of Paulmier’s fig. 42 with my <a href="#plate_ii">fig. 4</a>
suggests the thought that they are the same stage, and his fibers are remains
of the spindle. His fig. 43, of course, agrees with my <a href="#plate_ii">fig. 25</a>;
and fig. 43 may correspond to <a href="#plate_ii">figs. 26 or 14</a>,
only that his stain is weaker.</p>

<p>Meves’s investigations are the most extensive of the recent ones on
the nebenkern. He has used <i>Paludina</i> and <i>Pygæra</i> as his objects.
The consideration of the mitochondrion in the spermatocytes I shall
pass over, as it is not within the bounds of this paper; yet I hope
to study the earlier generations of my material, and shall then
compare the results. In Meves’s description of <i>Paludina</i>, I find but
one point in which it agrees with <i>Gryllus</i>. The head of the young
spermatozoon in <i>Paludina</i> has a clear space in the center filled
with nuclear fluid, which remains till the head begins to stretch. In
<i>Gryllus</i> it is hollow until maturity.</p>

<p class="blockquot"> In <i>Paludina</i> the nebenkern in one kind of
spermatids is formed from threads made up of mitochondria—small,
round bodies identical with St. George’s cytomicrosomes and
Erlanger’s centrodeutoplasm. These threads change to vesicles, which,
reduced to four, closely surround the centrosome as it lengthens
into the middle piece. At first they form a four-cleft cylinder, but
finally a single sheath. An idiozome and spindle remains are seen
in the spermatid. They persist for awhile, and the former changes
into the acrosome. In <i>Pygæra</i> Meves finds two kinds of spermatids,
distinguished by a small difference in size. The larger forms the
typical spermatozoon. The spindle remains form a “Spindelrest
körper,” which is soon lost. The ends of the mitochondrion chains
form a ring of dark mass surrounding a clear space. The ring is
broken by radiating clear spaces. These spaces collect and unite into
larger vacuoles, which surround the darker center. Finally there is
only a dark ball with a surrounding clear space shut in by a ring.
The centrosome with attached axial filament fastens itself to the
nucleus; then both begin to grow longer. The axial filament passes
over the surface of the ring surrounding the ball—the “mitochondrion
körper” or nebenkern. This body elongates a great deal then the
darker mass puts forth numerous threads which surround the axial
filament. </p>

<p>As to <i>Pygæra</i>, the peculiarity is the complete agreement of his
“mitochondrion körper” and my nebenkern in appearance and behavior
for a part of the transformation and their complete disagreement in
the other part. The question with me is, “Do the two bodies whose
final stages are so similar originate so differently, or has one of
us mistaken the origin of the body?”</p>

<p>Since reading Meves’s paper I have carefully reexamined my material,
and I am positive that I am right as to the origin of the nebenkern;
but, on the other hand, I would not say that Meves is wrong in his
observations, as in doing so I should fall into the same error which
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[60]</a></span>
I think Meves himself has made. In his discussion of the literature
he has forced every description to agree with his ideas, or has
declared that the author has described some extra-nuclear organ as
a nebenkern which is <i>not</i> a nebenkern. Thus by implication, if not
by direct statement, he says that a nebenkern never comes from the
spindle remains. With due respect to his ability and long experience
as an investigator, I must say that Meves is mistaken in this. St.
George himself traced the cytomicrosomes back to the spindle remains.
Besides, the many investigators whom I have cited above cannot be
mistaken as to the origin of the nebenkern. In my own material I am
positive that there is a direct passing of the interzonal fibers over
into the earlier stages of the nebenkern.</p>

<p>That the body which forms the tail covering does not come from the
spindle remains in all cases, I am willing to admit. Meves has cited
many investigators, especially on vertebrates, whose results favor
such an opinion. The spindle remains do not change into a nebenkern
even in all Arthropods, as Blackman (’01) finds no nebenkern, nor
anything in anywise resembling it, in <i>Scolopendra</i>.</p>

<p>From my study of the results of other investigators, it is evident
to me that there are at least two general methods for the formation
of the covering for the spermatozoon tail. One of these plans will
harmonize Meves’s mitochondrion körper, Erlanger’s centrodeutoplasm,
Heidenhain’s pseudo-chromosomes, and other similar structures. The
other will show that Platner’s large mitosome, Paulmier’s blackberry
stage and my striated nebenkern are only different stages of the
spindle remains changing into the tail covering.</p>

<h3>V.—Summary.</h3>
</div>

<p>1. The chromosomes of the second spermatocytes break up and the
chromatin becomes diffused all through the nucleus. Later the
chromatin collects in granules again and finally forms the walls of
the tube-like spermatozoon head.</p>

<p>2. The spindle fibers break loose as the clear space is formed around
the chromatin mass. They unite and contract, becoming fewer, thicker,
and shorter. These bend and form the “striated nebenkern.” The fibers
break up and sometimes show a blackberry appearance. Soon there is a
collection of darker material at the center, surrounded by a clear
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[61]</a></span>
space, which is shut off from the cytoplasm by a darkly staining
membrane which in sections appears as a ring. This stage persists
for some time; then the nebenkern moves against the axial filament,
elongates, loses the ring, and the dark mass passes down along the
axial filament. Often it appears in several small drops.</p>

<p>3. The axial filament does not come from the nebenkern nor from the
acrosome. It comes apparently from the nucleus; probably from the
centrosome closely attached to the nucleus. It never passes through
the nebenkern—only over its surface.</p>

<p>4. The acrosome occupies a position in the angle between the
nebenkern and the nucleus. It shows a central clear space surrounded
by a darker mass which stains more intensely on one side. Later
it passes to the front of the nucleus and forms the point of the
spermatozoon head.</p>

<p>5. The mature spermatozoon consists of a sharp point, a slender,
tube-like head filled with a clear fluid, and a long, thread-like tail.</p>

<h3>Explanation of Plate II.</h3>

<p>All drawings were made by the author with the aid of a camera
lucida. All figures except 2, 3, 4 and 45 were made with a B. &amp; L.
<sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>16</sub> objective and one inch eye-piece, producing a magnification
of 1340 diameters. Figs. 2, 3, 4 and 45 were drawn with a Leitz
<sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>16</sub> objective and a Zeiss compensating ocular No. 12, giving a
magnification of 2325 diameters. The drawings were not reduced in the
photo-mechanical reproduction.</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p><span class="smcap">Fig. 1.</span> An early telophase, in which the fibers appear like
barrel staves. Some of the fibers have thickened.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Fig. 2.</span> A later stage, in which the fibers are uniting, the
clear space is forming, and the chromosomes are beginning to separate.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Fig. 3.</span> A daughter-cell, showing the chromosomes separating
and the fibers thickening.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Fig. 4.</span> The chromosomes are scattered over the nuclear
membrane; the fibers appear as a few thick rods. The beginning of the
acrosome is seen. The accessory chromosome can be distinguished.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Fig. 5.</span> Same as fig. 4, with some of the fibers curved and
no acrosome.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Fig. 6.</span> Same as fig. 5, but with the acrosome visible.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Fig. 7.</span> The chromosomes are granular; the fibers have bent
and formed the round “striated nebenkern.” The acrosome is present.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Fig.</span> 8<i>a</i>. Same as fig. 7, but the acrosome is not present.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Fig.</span> 8<i>b</i>. The fibers run parallel with the long axis of the
nebenkern.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Fig. 9.</span> Here is shown a partial end view of the nebenkern.
The accessory chromosome and the acrosome are both prominent.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Fig. 10.</span> The nebenkern shows some of the fibers on the under
side. It is beginning to break up.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Fig. 11.</span> The nebenkern shows the beginning of the dark
center; the fibers extend from it to the ring. The acrosome has a
peculiar appearance.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Fig. 12.</span> The fibers have broken up and the whole has assumed
a vesicular appearance, resembling a blackberry. The acrosome is present.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Fig. 13.</span> This shows a persisting spermatid stage. The
chromatin appears in patches. The nebenkern is in the ball-and-ring
stage. The acrosome shows its characteristic clear center surrounded
by a ring darker on one side. The two dark bodies on the nuclear
surface are probably artefacts.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Fig. 14.</span> A stage a little later than 13. The dark central
ball shows some vacuoles. The cell is beginning to elongate.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Fig. 15.</span> Same as fig. 14, with the ball denser.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Fig. 16.</span> The nucleus has become almost clear. The acrosome
is behind the nebenkern.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Fig. 17.</span> This shows the axial filament apparently growing
out from the nucleus. There is an aggregation of chromatin at its base.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Fig. 18.</span> The axial filament passes over the nebenkern, which
has slightly elongated. The accessory chromosome is very plain.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Fig. 19.</span> <i>a</i> shows a surface view, and <i>b</i> an optical
section, of a nebenkern which is in process of breaking up.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Figs. 20</span> and 21 have part of the surface fibers cut off and
show the dark mass forming within.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Fig. 22.</span> Shows a nebenkern passing from the blackberry stage
into the ring stage.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Fig. 23.</span> This is an end view of the stage shown in figs. 20 and 21.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Fig. 24.</span> The fainter lines are the fibers on the under side
of the nebenkern.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Fig. 25.</span> The blackberry stage, showing the mass of vesicles.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Fig. 26.</span> This represents a nebenkern of the stage shown in
fig. 7, drawn from a polar view, with adjusting focus.</p></div>

passing down along the filament. The acrosome is indistinct.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Fig. 32.</span> The nebenkern has disappeared, but the acrosome has
kept its position.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Fig. 33.</span> The acrosome has flattened against the nucleus.
Some remains of the nebenkern are seen.</p>

provided that

* You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
  the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
  you already use to calculate your applicable taxes. The fee is owed
  to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he has
  agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation. Royalty payments must be paid
  within 60 days following each date on which you prepare (or are
  legally required to prepare) your periodic tax returns. Royalty
  payments should be clearly marked as such and sent to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the address specified in
  Section 4, "Information about donations to the Project Gutenberg
  Literary Archive Foundation."

* You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
  you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
  does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
  License. You must require such a user to return or destroy all
  copies of the works possessed in a physical medium and discontinue
  all use of and all access to other copies of Project Gutenberg-tm
  works.

* You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of
  any money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
  electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days of
  receipt of the work.

* You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
  distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9. If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work or group of works on different terms than
are set forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing
from both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and The
Project Gutenberg Trademark LLC, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark. Contact the Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg-tm collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.

1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees. YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3. LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from. If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person
or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second
opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4. Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS', WITH NO
OTHER WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT
LIMITED TO WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5. Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of
damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement
violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the
agreement shall be interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or
limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or
unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the
remaining provisions.

1.F.6. INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in
accordance with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the
production, promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, harmless from all liability, costs and expenses,
including legal fees, that arise directly or indirectly from any of
the following which you do or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this
or any Project Gutenberg-tm work, (b) alteration, modification, or
additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org



Section 3. Information about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation

The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non profit
501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the
state of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal
Revenue Service. The Foundation's EIN or federal tax identification
number is 64-6221541. Contributions to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation are tax deductible to the full extent permitted by
U.S. federal laws and your state's laws.

The Foundation's principal office is in Fairbanks, Alaska, with the
mailing address: PO Box 750175, Fairbanks, AK 99775, but its
volunteers and employees are scattered throughout numerous
locations. Its business office is located at 809 North 1500 West, Salt
Lake City, UT 84116, (801) 596-1887. Email contact links and up to
date contact information can be found at the Foundation's web site and
official page at www.gutenberg.org/contact

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
